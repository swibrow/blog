Hello, my name is Samuel and I'm a platform engineer, cloud engineer, and DevOps professional. I'm originally from Australia and moved to Germany in 2015 to pursue my career in technology. Over the years, I've gained extensive experience and have established myself as a respected professional in the industry.

Throughout my professional experience, I have worked with cutting-edge technologies in cloud computing, software development, and infrastructure management. As a platform engineer, I design and implement scalable, reliable, and secure platforms that enable organizations to deliver their products and services to customers.

In my role as a cloud engineer, I am responsible for the deployment, management, and maintenance of cloud-based infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). I have a deep understanding of cloud-based architectures and am skilled in using tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform.

I also have expertise in DevOps, a methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. I have experience in automating the software development pipeline, from code development to testing and deployment, using tools such as CircleCi, Git, and Terraform.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time outdoors, particularly snowboarding and cycling. I am passionate about staying active and am always looking for new challenges and adventures.

I strive to be an expert in the technology industry through my dedication to my craft and my passion for staying active and enjoying the outdoors. I hope to inspire others to pursue their passions and find balance in their professional and personal lives.
