My name is Samuel, jack of all trades, master of none, bidding platform engineer. I focus on building simple yet powerful technology stacks to enhance developer experience and drive business growth. I originally hailed from Australia and moved to Germany in 2015 to develope my career in technology. Over the years, I've gained extensive experience and have established myself as a respected professional in the industry. Recently I made the move to Switzerland purely for the accessibility of Raclette.

In my career, I've worked with various technologies in cloud computing, software development, and infrastructure management. I developed a set of skills in DevOps, a methodology that emphasises collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. I have experience in automating the software development pipeline, from code development to testing and deployment, using tools such as CircleCi, Git, and Terraform.

When I'm not working, I'm either dabbling in side projects, on the saddle or b-lining it down a mountain on my snowboard.

I strive to be an expert in the technology industry through my dedication to my craft and my passion for staying active and enjoying the this beautiful place we call earth.
