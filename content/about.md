Hi! I'm Sam, jack of all trades, master of none, ultimate generalist. I focus on building **simple** technology stacks to enhance developer experience and while keeping their sanity. I originally hailed from Australia and moved to Germany in 2015 to develop my career in tech. Over the years, I've gained extensive experience and have established myself as a respected professional in the industry. Recently, I made the move to Switzerland purely for the accessibility of Raclette.

In my career, I've worked with various technologies in cloud computing, software development, and infrastructure management. I've developed a strong skill set in DevOps, a methodology that emphasises collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. I'm currently having an absolute blast working with AI and exploring its potential to transform industries.

When I'm not working, I'm either dabbling in unfinished side projects, on the saddle, or b-lining it down a mountain on my snowboard.

I strive to be an expert in the technology industry through my dedication to my craft and my passion for staying active and enjoying this beautiful place we call Earth.
