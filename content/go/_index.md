I started out the year with a goal to become an Go developer but after a few weeks of completing few courses I lost track of the goal, in my own defence I had my first child shortly before making this decision and thought I would spend more time at home and thus a an extra hour a day on the computer while the little fella slept sounded reasonable. Well I was completely wrong and setting aside time on a daily basis was wishful thinking.

But now he's about to hit 1 year old and sleeps pretty well in the mornings so I have a bit of time in the mornings. Looking to the end of the years theres 70 days and the last 10 will be spent in Estonia for the Christmas. So I'm going to a 60 days of Go.

Day 1 will be to review the courses I've already completed and see if I can remember anything and set out a plan for the next 59 days. I also purchased the book `Learning Go, An Idiomatic Approach to Real World Go Programming` by Jon Bodner.

By the end, I want to have completed the following:

- [ ] The book `Learning Go, An Idiomatic Approach to Real World Go Programming`
- [ ] Rest API that uses Github as an OAuth provider
- [ ] CLI tool that initialises a terraform directories (wrapper around terraform init)
- [ ] Kubernetes Controller (KubeBuilder)
