Use Renovate packageRules to migrate action references across repos when Github org needs to be changed:

```json
{
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchDatasources": ["github-tags"],
      "matchPackageNames": ["old-org/github-workflows"],
      "replacementName": "new-org/github-workflows",
      "groupName": "Github Workflow Migration"
    }
  ]
}
```

This was super helpful when we migrated our shared workflows over to a new org and needed to update 100s of repos. We then we able to handover the work for merging to the devs responsible for each repo.
