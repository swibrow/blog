I&rsquo;m originally from Australia and moved to Germany in 2015 to pursue my career in technology. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve gained extensive experience and have established myself as a respected professional in the industry.</p><p>Throughout my professional experience, I have worked with cutting-edge technologies in cloud computing, software development, and infrastructure management. As a platform engineer, I design and implement scalable, reliable, and secure platforms that enable organizations to deliver their products and services to customers.</p><p>In my role as a cloud engineer, I am responsible for the deployment, management, and maintenance of cloud-based infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). I have a deep understanding of cloud-based architectures and am skilled in using tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform.</p><p>I also have expertise in DevOps, a methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. I have experience in automating the software development pipeline, from code development to testing and deployment, using tools such as Jenkins, Git, and Ansible.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy spending time outdoors, particularly snowboarding and cycling. I am passionate about staying active and am always looking for new challenges and adventures.</p><p>I strive to be an expert in the technology industry through my dedication to my craft and my passion for staying active and enjoying the outdoors. I hope to inspire others to pursue their passions and find balance in their professional and personal lives.</p><img src=/me.jpg width=100% style=vertical-align:middle></div></div></main></div><footer class=footer>Â© 2023 Samuel Wibrow, Built with
