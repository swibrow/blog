On May 5th, 2024, I started my day with a refreshing game of tennis. The session, named 'Lunch Tennis', had a total distance of 1663.5 meters and a total elevation gain of 5.7 meters. I spent 1429 seconds on the court, with an average speed of 1.164 m/s and an average heart rate of 111.2 bpm.

After my tennis session, I also made some contributions on GitHub. I deleted a repository, created a new one, and worked on a few pull requests and push events.

Overall, it was a productive day filled with physical activity and coding. Looking forward to more days like this in the future!
