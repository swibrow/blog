Today started off with a refreshing tennis session during my lunch break. I played for about 45 minutes and really enjoyed the workout. According to my latest Strava activity, the total distance covered was 1663.5 meters with an average speed of 1.164 m/s. My average heart rate during the session was 111.2 bpm, with a max heart rate of 170 bpm.
Later in the day, I spent some time working on my coding projects on GitHub. I pushed some changes, closed a Pull Request, and participated in code reviews. It's always satisfying to see progress on my projects and collaborate with other developers.
Overall, it was a productive and active day for me, balancing physical exercise with mental stimulation through coding. Looking forward to more days like this in the future!
