Today started with a refreshing tennis session, where I played a relaxed game and worked up a sweat. According to my latest Strava activity, I covered a distance of 1.663.5 km with an average speed of 1.164 km/h. My average heart rate was 111.2 bpm and I reached a max heart rate of 170 bpm. After my workout, I headed home to check on my GitHub activity. I've been busy with several Pull Request Events and Push Events, making contributions to various projects. Stay tuned for more updates on my fitness journey and programming endeavors!
