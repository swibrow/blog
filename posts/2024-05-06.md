Today started with a refreshing game of tennis. I logged a relaxed workout on Strava, playing a match that lasted for 1429 seconds and covered a distance of 1663.5 meters. Later in the day, I switched gears and delved into coding on Github. I had several events, including PushEvents, PullRequestEvents, and DeleteEvents, showcasing my activity on the platform. It was a productive day filled with a mix of physical activity and coding challenges.
